## 1. Special numbers

Print all the numbers between `10` and `1313` (both included) which are
divisible by `13` and multiple of `5`.

## 2. FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
`3` print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of` 5` print
`Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both `3` and `5` print `FizzBuzz`.

## 3. Analyse a repeat structure

We are going to make a repeating DNA sequence and extract some subsequences
from it.
- Make a short tandem repeat that consists of three "ACGT" units and five
"TTATT" units.
- Print all suffixes of the repeat structure.
  - **Note**: A suffix is an ending. For example, the word "spam" has five
  suffixes: "spam", "pam", "am", "m" and "".
- Print all substrings of length 3.
- Print all unique substrings of length 3.

## 4. Bank account simulator

Take as input an initial bank account balance (e.g., `1000`). Next, accept
inputs consisting of either expenses (e.g., `-13.99`) or revenues (e.g., `20`)
until the user introduces exit . After each input, in case the balance is
about to go negative, print an error message (e.g., `Operation not permitted:
insufficient funds.`). Otherwise, print the new balance value.

## 5. Dictionaries

We are going to store the output of a function (f(x)=x2) together with its
input in a dictionary.
- Make a dictionary containing all squares smaller than 100.
- Print the content of this dictionary in english, e.g., "4 is the square of 2".

## 6. Nested dictionaries

Assume a dictionary that has country names as keys and as values another
dictionary with the following keys: `continent`, `capital`, `population`.
Example:

    {
      'The Netherlands': {
        'capital': 'Amsterdam',
        'population': 17283008,
        'continent': 'Europe',
      },
      'France': {
        'capital': 'Paris',
        'population': 67186638,
        'continent': 'Europe',
      },
      'USA': {
        'capital': 'Washington, D.C.',
        'population': 327167434,
        'continent': 'North America',
      }
    }


- Allow for user input to add new countries in the dictionary.
- Print the country with the largest population (both its name and its population).
- Print how many countries are from a particular continent, which is introduced
by the user.
